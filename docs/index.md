# Creating order out of the Agile chaos

Whatever approach we follow, the principles behind all software development success are similar. The traditional as well as the Agile method require good team work, communication, appropriate tools and facilities, and some kind of agreed upon protocols to be followed. Enough is already written about Scrum and Sprint, or Chicken and Pigs. Let me highlight some of the factors that contribute to the success of Agile methods.

## Agile is not synonymous to chaos

Shifting from the traditional SDLC models give a notion of breaking free from the traditional binding rules and leads to chaos. But that is not true. Most often Agile process do not work well when stakeholders are not matured enough to handle changes.

## Communication is the lifeblood in Agile process

Unless a strict regime of open omni-directional communication is established you are exposed to risk.

## Size does matter

The risk of success or failure depends on the team size. You must decide on an optimal team size that can contribute positively to meet the desired goals.

## Estimations are supposed to go wrong â€“ But not in Agile

If you think estimates are only estimates and they will go wrong, then you are bidding for trouble. Plan only as much as can be taken up during a Sprint. Keep the rest for next Sprint.

## Keep stand-up meetings short

Only three questions to answer by each Pig. What have you done since the last meeting? What are you planning to do till the next meeting? Is there anything stopping you from meeting your target?

## Strong Chickens

You have to get strong people to guide the Pigs.

## First have enough process orientation in place

Agile is not for organizations which do not have any process orientation maturity. Before jumping on Agile evaluate whether your organization has enough maturity towards process orientation.
